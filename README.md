## Functionality
WHEN I open the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.
WHEN I scroll down, then I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours from 9:00 to 17:00.
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day, then each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
WHEN I click into a timeblock, then I can enter an event.
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock, then the text for that event is saved in local storage.
WHEN I refresh the page, then the saved events persist
